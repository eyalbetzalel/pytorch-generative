"""Implementation of PixelSNAIL [1].

PixelSNAIL extends PixelCNN [2] (and its variants) by introducing a causally
masked attention layer. This layer extends the model's receptive field by 
allowing each pixel to explicitly depend on all previous pixels. PixelCNN's
receptive field, on the other hand, can only be increased by using deeper 
networks with more convolutions. The attention block also naturally resolves 
the blind spot issue which PixelCNN suffers from without needing a complex two 
stream architecture.

Unlike [1], we use skip connections from each PixelSNAILBlock to the output.
We find that this greatly stabilizes the model during training and gets rid of
exploding gradient issues. It also massively speeds up convergence.
